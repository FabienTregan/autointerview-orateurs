Question cool mais :

-Pas expert
-Pas bon centraliser, pourtant interactions les plus riches
-Pas bon non centraliser
-Pas bon cadre pour répondre
-Poser des questions est dur
-Choix questions ?
-Attaques (table rondes, angle contradictoires, ok, mais pas prets)

-Dommage pas questions
-Alternatives (thomas et julie, devfest toulouse mais free consulting, ...)



#Why isn't my last slide "question ?"

Question at the end of talks are sometimes great, and most speaker will have a last "questions ?" slide in their deck. However, I don't. Both because I don't always think it is a good use of the time I am given to speak, and because I want to show that questions are not mandatory and that one is allowed to speak publicly without taking questions at the end.

In this probably too long writing I will try to explain why.

## Topic expertise level

Some people are experts in the subject they will speak about. They have both knowledge and culture that really extend the part they will choose to cover during a talk. It *is* great to have questions to give the attendees the opportunity to decide which part of the subject should be given some additionnal time to match their interest (either because it was not brought during the talk, or because they would want it to be addressed more fully)

But some speakers are not. It is perfectly ok to take a subject, spend time learning about it, and build a talk relating what you find both to give you motivation to digg the subject and because you think find interesting things you think others would be happy to hear about.

One can have a very interesting approach of a topic, or bring an interesting but underrated subject, without being an expert. Feeling obliged to take questions could be intimidating to some, stoping them from proposing the talk, and can make others try to look like experts when it is neither true nor bringing value.
