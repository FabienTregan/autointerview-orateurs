# That last "Questions ?" slide 

Questions at the end of talks are sometimes great, and most speakers will have a last "Questions ?" slide in their deck. However, I don't. Both because I don't always think it is a good use of the time I am given, and because I want to show people that questions are not mandatory and they are allowed to publicly speak without accepting questions.

I will try to explain why.


## My problem with questions


### Expertise level

Some speakers are experts in the subject they speak about. They have knowledge, culture and understanding that extend way past the part they cover during a talk. It is great to be able to ask questions to have them (deeeper) cover some point.

But other speakers are not. It is perfectly ok to take a subject, spend some time learning about it and, if you find interesting things, want to share it and find an additionnal motivation to digg the subject.

One can have a very interesting approach of a topic, or bring visibility to an interesting but underrated subject, without being an expert. Feeling obliged to take questions could be intimidating to some - stoping them from proposing the talk. It and can make others try to look like experts when it is neither true nor bringing value.


### Centralized exchange

It is nice to give a talk that bring discussions. I think the most (only ?) valuable thing I said at a conference was an answer to a question, and it was to an almost out of the topic of question.

Anyway, I do not think the traditionnal "Questions ?" slide - whith questions directed to the speaker who still has a microphone and stands on a podium - is a good format to bring interesting discussions.

The circle that often forms in the corridor after the talk, with fewer and more interested people who all contribute, is way richer and less prone to some of the problem I will describe in later chapters.


### Taking away the lead from the speaker

The "questions" time can serve as a tribune to people who want to express their experience, opinions, concerns...

It is important, often enlightning, to let people share the thoughts or emotions caused by a topic. But listening is hard. But the "questions" time is not designed to help one to five hundred people -who did not came for that- listening to one person expressing personnal concerns to a speaker via a microphone from the middle of the hall.

Speakers can't really answer to something that is not a question. The format is designed to be speaker centric and I don't remember seeing such moments bringing value to anybody.


### Question value

Even when asking real questions, asking good questions is hard. People are seldom aware of this, probably never trained in asking questions.

Independtly of the knowledge of the speaker, it is hard to bring global value to the audience when answering a question that is related to a concern that is specific to the people asking it, is not revelant to speaker's expertise, would deserve a dedicated talk...


### Time constrained answers

As a good talk will, a good answer often open a new perspectiv and you will be glad the question hade been asked.

But the time is usually running out. The speaker don't have much time to answer and often almost no time to think before answering. The stress level is often higher than attendees think, even for great speakers we admire!

I have seen people I appreciate giving quick and poor answers to questions about which they taugh me so much during long relaxed discussions. This convinced me questions is an uncertain exercice and it is likely that speakers can bring more value by using those five minutes differently.


### Choosing the question

Is it almost impossible for the organisers to know who will bring interesting questions. At best the choice is random, most of the time it is based on personnal biases, giving the microphone to either the noisier or the shyer person, the closer to the organizer or the farther from the one who asked the previous question.

I often feel unconfortable with what I see during the "Questions" time - as an attendee even more as a speaker because I can pay more attention. 


### Attacks

Up to there, I have only spoken about things I hade experienced.

I remember a math teacher at university telling us not to come at his presentation because we'd see people from different influence sphere booing him or whisteling at him. I've seen people coming to talks only to express their disagreement. I've heard people not wanting to get into public speaking because they hade seen people from their minority having their legitimity attacked during the questions.

I am completely in favor of conferences designed with with contradictory opinions and interesting and respectfull discussions in mind, with people skilled in debates who gave informed accepting of it. I am also in favor of having a clear communication to attendees of expertise, involvment, and point of view of a speaker.

Of course you understand that I do not think that the questions time has the proper design for this.


## Then what ?


### Questions as a case by case decision.

First, as a speaker or an attendee, please, please, remember that questions is something that you can decide to hade to your talk if you think it the best way to spend some of the time you have.

As slides, live coding, or interaction with the audience, questions is something you can explicitely decide to do on a case by case basis if you think it brings value. If the conference organisers say you have "50 minutes including questions", 50 minutes talk plus 0 minutes questions meets the requirement. 

There is a talk about a personnal project I gave four times. Only once did I decide to take question, because it was in a different envinronment and for a different audience. Also because the corridor discussion after the talk, the first times I gave it, made me undertood things differently and made me confortable with discussing with this specific audience. I'm glad I did.


### Alternativ as at individual level

As a speaker, you can tell people that you won't take questions during the talk time, but will be happy to discuss during the break. Such group often spontaneously forms anyway when people are really interested in discussing with you. Exchange are usually rich and respectfull.

You can also design your talks differently. Claire Zuliani (ZooletteDesBois) and Thomas Parisot (@oncletom) gave a talk at MiXiT 2018 starting by telling people they did not want to give a talk but create a discussion. I think they wanted to reoarganise the chair to make a circle but that was difficult in the available time. They told they expected people to be part of the content. They didn't have a fixed content for their not-talk and it allowed them to give time to people. People in return felt reponsible about their contribution and the exchange was great.

As an attendee, if you ask a question at the microphone during the "Q? slide", try to ask yourself if you are asking the question because you think it is a good contribution to the talk, or because you want to speak ( hard to restrain :) ) or because you need something that bring value mostly to you (you probably can ask the question face to face to the speaker later, she/he will have more time and be able to give a more specific answer)


### Alternativ formats


Many conferences (or unconferences) have formats that creates easyer conditions for exchanges:
- [DevFest Toulouse](https://devfesttoulouse.fr/) 2018 tryed to have an "office hour" : after each talk, the speakers stayed at a desk during the next talk and people could come and ask them question. This is great to answer specific question (providing expertise, discussing opportunities, ...)
- The [!!Con](http://bangbangcon.com/) (that I unfortunately never intended) has ten minutes slots with lot of breaks and "unconference" time
- [Unconferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) (or open forums) have slots about subjects that are freely proposed by attendees and often don't have speakers. You just expect to have the same kind of conversation you could have with friends of people you meet in a conference when you are not attending a talk.
