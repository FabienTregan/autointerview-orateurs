Question cool mais :

-Pas expert
-Pas bon centraliser, pourtant interactions les plus riches
-Pas bon non centraliser
-Pas bon cadre pour répondre
-Poser des questions est dur
-Choix questions ?
-Attaques (table rondes, angle contradictoires, ok, mais pas prets)

-Dommage pas questions
-Alternatives (thomas et julie, devfest toulouse mais free consulting, ...)



# Why isn't my last slide "question ?"

Question at the end of talks are sometimes great, and most speaker will have a last "questions ?" slide in their deck. However, I don't. Both because I don't always think it is a good use of the time I am given to speak, and because I want to show people that questions are not mandatory and they are allowed to publicly speak without taking questions.

I will try to explain why.

## Expertise level

Some speakers are experts in the subject they speak about. They have knowledge, culture and understanding that extend way past the part they cover during a talk. It is great to be able to ask questions to have them (deeeper) cover some point.

But other speakers are not. It is perfectly ok to take a subject, spend some time learning about it and, if you find interesting things, want to share it and find an additionnal motivation to digg the subject.

One can have a very interesting approach of a topic, or bring visibility to an interesting but underrated subject, without being an expert. Feeling obliged to take questions could be intimidating to some - stoping them from proposing the talk. It and can make others try to look like experts when it is neither true nor bringing value.

## Centralized exchange

It is nice to give a talk that bring discussions. I think the most (only ?) valuable thing I said at a conference was an answer to a question, and it was to an almost out of the topic of question.

Anyway, I do not think the traditionnal "Questions ?" slide - whith questions directed to the speaker who still has a microphone and stands on a podium - is a good format to bring interesting discussions.

The circle that often forms in the corridor after the talk, with fewer and more interested people who all contribute, is way richer and less prone to some of the problem I will describe in later chapters.

## Taking away the lead from the speaker

The "questions" time can serve as a tribune to people who want to express their experience, opinions, concerns... Speakers can't really answer to something that is not a question.

These will seldom bring value to the attendees, and can be an awkward moment for both attendees and speakers.

## Answers value

As a good talk will, a good answer will often open a new perspectiv and you will be glad the question hade been asked.

But the time is usually running out. The speaker don't have much time to answer and often almost no time to think before answering. The stress level is often higher than attendees think, even for great speakers we admire!

I have seen people I appreciate giving quick and poor answers to questions about which they taugh me so much during long relaxed discussions. This convinced me questions is an uncertain exercice and it is likely that speakers can bring more value by using those five minuts differently.
